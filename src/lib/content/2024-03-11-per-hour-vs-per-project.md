title: Per hour vs Per project ðŸ’¡
---

The idea started with [Tejas Kumar tweet](https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1767165463954374737) about how to bill contracts... Per hour or Per project?

Let's look at **Per hour** first. It's a good way to bill when the scope is not clear, or when the project is expected to change a lot. And you can start directly, you just need to set a rate and Gooooo!

> I feel that per hour less engaging.

On the other end, **Per project** you need to do a few go and back prior starting to define a scope, a timeline, and a price with the client. In the end, this preparation doesn't bring value to the product itself and it's time consuming before even starting. It's also less flexibility during developement as the scope is agreed and fixed.
