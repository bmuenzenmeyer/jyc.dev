title: Thumbnail & metadata as PNG
---

Today, while scroling X, I saw [Basti Ui tweet](https://twitter.com/BastiUi/status/1779866139880755295) about his issue with the thumbnail and metadata of his youtube videos. Then [Benjamin Code](https://twitter.com/benjamincode/status/1779876164296937928) added on top a challenge !

It looks like it's a common problem to be able to share a simple _(and nice ðŸŽ¨)_ thumbnail with title & metadata. I remember having the same issue with my videos... so it could be a cool experiment to see what I can build around this.

Features built so far:

- [x] Available on [https://jyc.dev/thumb-meta](/thumb-meta)
- [x] Prefix the current youtube video to be able to go to the png preview. So if you are on `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL95jQGMPX0` just add `jyc.dev/` infront and it should bring you to the png preview. Check out this: [https://jyc.dev/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL95jQGMPX0](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL95jQGMPX0)
- [x] You can choose between light & drak mode
