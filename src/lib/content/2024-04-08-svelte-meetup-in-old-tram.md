title: Svelte Meetup in an old Vienna Tram
---

On the 8 of April 2024, we organized with [Ermin](http://ermeen.com/) and [Domenik](https://github.com/dreitzner) a [Svelte Austria Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/svelte-society-austria/events/298699278/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link). We try to do 4 meetups a year and this one was the first of 2024.

It was a very special edition as we rented an old Vienna Tram to hold the meetup! It was so much fun to prepare... And to do ! We managed to show how Svelte & SvelteKit are working and played a game with multiple flows. The game was a hit! Each participant received a card assigning them a role, and we built a live play. This interactive approach not only made the event more engaging but also helped everyone understand the practical application of Svelte & SvelteKit in a fun and memorable way.
